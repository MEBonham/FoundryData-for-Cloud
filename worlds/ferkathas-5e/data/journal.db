This very secure facility is Tolfos's warehouse, where his extra goods are kept.</p>\n<p>The shop portion of the building is further divided in two to keep the \"General Store\" separate from the \"Magic Shop.\" The two halves are joined by an area for Tolfos to sit, behind a counter that goes all the way around him. The General Store is cluttered with goods to buy, while the Magic Shop is mostly filled with decorations. A few magic items are kept in glass cases, and there is a suit of plate armor on display in one corner, but generally one's eyes are mostly drawn to abstract sculptures of spun glass that fill the space.</p>\n<p>If challenged about his stock about magic items, Tolfos will explain that it's simply not safe to keep magic items on display, and that most of his stock is locked away in the warehouse until demanded (except for a few common items that he keeps behind the counter with him, like his stock of @Item[5IVgZvqUBuU71yj3]{Healing Potions}, are you interested in those?). Furthermore, it's just impossible to predict demand for more unusual items, so for more esoteric things, he usually has to use his \"connections\" (of which he is proud) to order things quickly, rather than having them in the shop on-demand.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>Actually the warehouse is mostly empty, except for the teleportation circle that Dimefinos uses to travel between \"Tolfos's\" shop and his lair deep within @JournalEntry[RWHucd7pBiK3JXSS]{Felwarren Dungeon}.</p>\n<p>The part about Tolfos having impressive mercantile connections that he uses to order esoteric magic items from the South, amazingly quickly, is true. His ability to cast&nbsp;<em>Sending</em> helps.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>Prices</h2>\n<p>Tolfos is a stickler about charging a full 50 gp for every @Item[5IVgZvqUBuU71yj3]{Potion of Healing} sold, even if adventurers try to get some kind of bulk discount. If provoked, he might rave about how even 50 gp is underpriced, considering how fast they always seem to vanish.</p>\n<p>His prices on other magic items are quite generous; though, about 7% less than one would normally find in a magic shop, as long as the customer is an adventurer who is exploring (or intending to explore) @JournalEntry[RWHucd7pBiK3JXSS]{Felwarren Dungeon}. With other customers, he haggles and drives a hard bargain.</p>"}

Felwarren, however, has ascended beyond the status of a typical mining town: it is a tourist location of sorts, attracting would-be adventurers and sending them into its @JournalEntry[RWHucd7pBiK3JXSS]{dungeons} to fight monsters for glory and profit.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Surroundings</h1>\n<p>The Smigrin Empire is massive, the second-largest civilized nation in the world. Its northern border is defined by a mountain range called the Biworr Peaks, which separate it from the savage, hilly land of Biworr. The Mining District lies in the northern part of the Empire, along the southern and western outskirts of the mountains.</p>\n<h2>Biworr Proximity</h2>\n<p>This means that Felwarren is close to Biworr, a land full of barbaric creatures and worse. It is no secret that this is the origin of the creatures that adventurers fight in the Dungeon;&nbsp;<em>somewhere</em> in the dungeon is a connection to a cave system that emerges on the other side of the mountain range.</p>\n<h2>Other Surroundings</h2>\n<p>Felwarren lies nestled between two massive spurs of mountains that extend out south of the main mountain range. Many mining villages lie in the hills along these spurs, but demand for ore hasn't been high since the last Smigrin \"hot war\" 11 years ago, so these villages are more or less abandoned.</p>\n<p>The capital city of the Mining District lies across the West Spur, to the west and slightly south. It is called Elthakun, and is known for creating great works of craftsmanship from the ores mined there.</p>\n<p>On the east end of Felwarren is a connection to the Great South Road, which leads several days' journey south to the heartlands of the Smigrin Empire.</p>\n<p>The East Spur is wide enough that most of the Felwarren folk don't even care about what part of the Empire might be on the other side of it; it's considered impassible.</p>\n<h2>Climate</h2>\n<p>The land about Felwarren is rocky and somewhat dry, cooler than the Empire's heartlands (for which many of its inhabitants are grateful). Luckily, rain from the region does collect into a few creeks that feed into the lake on the southwest of the town. The town is very dependent on the water from this lake; otherwise they would have to supply their water primarily by magical means. The lake has no outlet, so its water tastes decidedly metallic, but is safe enough for now.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>History</h1>\n<p>Felwarren has existed for over a hundred years, but only grew from a village to a sizable town about 50 years ago, during a mining boom. As a mining town, its best exports were iron, silver, bauxite, and zinc.</p>\n<p>In the year 1500 V.Y. (37 years ago), during the latter years of the mining boom, a human mercenary woman named @Actor[FtEPBJMYwTcpG7fs]{Shirlin Sotei} passed through the town as a caravan guard. Two years later, when Felwarren was just beginning to struggle economically, Shirlin returned and founded @JournalEntry[zwlktKnMNJkh8pls]{The Caped Crawler}, effectively starting the town's tourism industry. Since then, the town has thrived, on the whole, growing to almost 9,000 inhabitants and becoming quite financially secure.</p>\n<p>Most would-be adventurers who visit Felwarren Dungeon don't stay long; they kill a few giant rats or goblins and move on, content with the status they enjoy as a Felwarren veteran, especially if they were lucky enough to find any treasure. Because few venture deep into the Dungeon, few likewise have died in their adventuring efforts. The Dungeon therefore has a reputation of being a relatively safe way to adventure; many even consider it to be a place of good luck.</p>\n<p>Because few venture deep into the Dungeon, however, much of it still remains mysterious in spite of having many visitors. (It doesn't help that Shirlin and her business partner @Actor[FOQRsNzuWj3Hw9hm]{Tolfos} strictly forbid the selling of maps of the interior.) Its connection to Biworr caves is somewhat obvious, but beyond that, where it leads and what creatures you are likely to find within are pretty much the subject of rumor. Some even say the Dungeon descends low enough to connect to The Deeps, but who knows?</p>\n<p>The northern reaches of town&nbsp;<em>are</em> fairly heavily guarded, in case anything emerges from the mountains or the Dungeon to ravage the town.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h1>Secrets</h1>\n<p>Felwarren Dungeon is&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;extensive. It connects to several underground regions, including The Deeps at the bottom.</p>\n<p>The continual success of adventurers there is more than just good fortune; it is a sinister plot by an Archdevil named Dimefinos, lord of the Dungeon, who masquerades as the friendly shopkeeper Tolfos in town most of the time. He has built two arcane beacons into the Dungeon that attract a continual supply of monsters, whose souls he harvests as they are slain.</p>\n<p>The souls are the real reason behind his scheme; he doesn't care too much for the success of his shop,&nbsp;@JournalEntry[jVbSDrmy4tELfJNz]{The Sparkling Beehive}, which is tempered by the pretty-good deals he gives adventurers on equipment there.</p>\n</section>"}
