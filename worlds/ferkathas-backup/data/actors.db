Stirges resemble nothing more than a slightly oversized bat crossed with a mosquito; however, upon closer inspection the Stirge reveals much more. Coated in greasy, pink flesh (save for a small tufted mane of white fur about its head and neck) the Stirge is equipped with a pair of small, bat-like wings made of stretched flesh between struts of thin bone. The skin here at the wing is so thin that light may easily shine through the beast's wings revealing the tiny vesicles within. Stirges also possess a set of six, spindly legs above their pig-like tail. Each leg is tipped with a set of hooked claws which allows the fiend to grip into the flesh of its prey and hang on should a struggle ensue. However, there is one more feature that makes the Stirge truly repugnant.</p>\n<p><strong>What's Your Type?</strong> Stirges are notable for their ravenous desire to consume the blood of living organisms. These beasts accomplish this foul act with aid from the needle-sharp proboscis waiting at the end of its oversized snout. Gifted with the ability of flight, the Stirge dives down upon an unsuspecting enemy and clamps onto their body with the aid of their barbed claws. The Stirge then drives its proboscis into their victim's flesh, sucking out ounce after ounce of warm blood. Only when the Stirge is sufficiently sated (or battered away) will it release its victim to flee into the darkness where it may digest its liquid lunch. Act fast if Stirges are in the area, lest a swarm of them suck you dry before you have time to react.</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Grassland","cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 284","class":{}},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","senses":"Darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":"","rwak":"","msak":"","rsak":"","abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""},"damage":"","abilityCheck":"","abilitySave":"","skillCheck":""},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"tDRumKb9mlMZWc8f","sort":900001,"flags":{"_sheetTab-sidebar":"abilities","_sheetTab-primary":"biography"},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Stirge.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Stirge","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Stirge.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":0.9,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"5UllErQHRUOdQRfk","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"ea0j1ZX1kxe2YCLL","flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"name":"Blood Drain","type":"weapon","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blood_03.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The stirge swoops down, pricking its target with its mouth and starts to suck blood.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>If the attack hits the stirge attaches to the target.

His hair and goatee are stark white, and have been from a relatively early age. He wears fairly expensive clothing, in the style of a merchant, and a longsword at his waist. He doesn't ever seem to talk about whether he knows how to wield the sword, but magic shop keepers generally seem to have <em>some</em> kind of self-defense skills.</p>\n<p>If Tolfos is not behind his counter in his shop, observers may note that his feet are rather large compared to the rest of his proportions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Known History</h2>\n<p>Tolfos was born to a wealthy family down in Vaultang, but taught to work as a merchant rather than relying on the family wealth.</p>\n<p>He was a career shopkeeper of a general store, but dared to dabble in magic item sales. In late 1502 V.Y., he heard from a passing bard about @Actor[FtEPBJMYwTcpG7fs]{Shirlin Sotei's} enterprise to found an inn catering to aspiring adventurers, taking advantage of @JournalEntry[RWHucd7pBiK3JXSS]{Felwarren Dungeon's} existence, and he thought it was a brilliant idea. He moved to Felwarren and gave Shirlin a sizable capital to help get @JournalEntry[zwlktKnMNJkh8pls]{The Caped Crawler} running. Then he bought an old mining warehouse just down the street from her and founded the Sparkling Beehive.</p>\n<p>Both he and Shirlin have been very successful, and have remained good friends while enjoying the profits of their labors.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 180 lb.</p>\n<h2>Big Secret</h2>\n<p>Tolfos is actually an alias for the archdevil Dimefinos, the \"Big Bad\" of the region. He is disguised by an Alter Self spell.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>More Alias Details</h2>\n<p>Tolfos is a casual believer in the Southern Viryan religion (the most popular religion in the region).</p>\n<p>He was divorced at a young age, with no children. If the subject of family comes up, he talks wistfully about his ex-wife at some length. Her name was Fiona, she was a redhead who washed dishes compulsively and would never stop talking about her birdwatching hobby. They fought over money all the time.</p>\n<p>His only current family is his beloved cat, Rammi, who lives at his house.</p>\n<p>He is very satisfied with his career. He likes to use the catchphrase \"Like a frog waiting for a fly\" whenever half-appropriate. He knows Smigrin and Rakian Common, which he was forced to learn as a child by an austere Rakian tutor.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Masquerade Habits</h2>\n<p>Obviously, as an archdevil, Dimefinos is far older than \"Tolfos\" appears to be, and subscribes to no mortal religion. His wealth reserves are also far vaster even than they seem to be, which explains why he can offer generous prices to adventurers who shop at his Magic Shop.</p>\n<p>Dimefinos spends most of his waking hours at the Beehive, but retreats to his lair in the Dungeon at night when the shop is closed. His house in town is a facade; he tries to keep it dusted, but a character who makes a DC 25 Perception or Investigation check there can find signs that it's not actually lived in. No one in town has really noticed that \"Tolfos\" is seldom seen walking between his shop and his house.</p>\n<p>His beloved cat, Rammi, is the product of a Major Image spell.</p>\n<p>A careful observer might note that Tolfos hires no employees to assist him with his shop, even though he clearly has the means to do so. This is a clue that he is keeping something secret.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>True History and Motivations</h2>\n<p>Dimefinos was banished from Carsigel to the Prime Plane about 1472 V.Y. (65 years ago) for scheming to topple his Devilish duke—typical devil stuff, really.

Her eyes lack an epicanthal fold, however, marking her as not purely Old Smigrin ethnically, in spite of what her last name sounds like.</p>\n<p>Shirlin wears pretty ordinary clothing, due to the danger to her wardrobe of working as a bartender.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Known History</h2>\n<p>As a young woman, Shirlin worked as a mercenary caravan guard, and passed through @JournalEntry[sVglzZF3B6yGR0LS]{Felwarren} in 1500 V.Y. (37 years ago). Two years later, she returned to the town, seeing the potential for an enterprising business there.</p>\n<p>She was right. Her inn-and-tavern, catering to adventurers who wish to explore @JournalEntry[RWHucd7pBiK3JXSS]{Felwarren Dungeon}, is famous far and wide for its success, and the success it supposedly imparts to its patrons.</p>\n<p>Besides her employees at the tavern, Shirlin is most closely associated with @Actor[FOQRsNzuWj3Hw9hm]{Tolfos}, the shopkeeper down the street who invested in her business from near its beginning.

She also considers the olive tree there something of a companion spirit, since it has been with her since the founding of her establishment.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>Important Detail</h2>\n<p>With a DC 10 Perception check, an observer can notice that the jeweled bracelet Shirlin wears is actually quite riddled with very expensive gems, and marks her as actually quite wealthy in spite of how plain the rest of her clothing is. The bracelet is worth 2,200 gp.</p>\n<h2>Private Life</h2>\n<p>Shirlin has no sexual attraction or interests to speak of, and is therefore a spinster. She is something of an open book, and is pretty happy with her lot in life as a wealthy business owner. She does not live in her own inn, but owns a nice manor on the eastern edge of town.</p>\n<p>All is not as it seems in her relationship with Tolfos. She doesn't know his big secret, but she is a little suspicious of how many of her debts to him he has forgiven over the years.

Bats are a nocturnal creature prized by arcanists for their ability to navigate terrain in near total darkness. This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar. Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight! Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp. What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night. The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath. The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigation without the aid of their eyes. It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color:

Dwellers of the coastal urban sprawl see the armored law keepers near daily as they patrol the streets, guard our gates, inspect shipments, and of course assist (or arrest) those citizens of their fair cities. However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls. Be they mercenary or professional, guards are often found patrolling the roads, either to sweep away stray packs of animals or bandits, or on alert to protect precious cargo or important citizens as they travel the less settled areas of the world. Much like the bandits and cultists who we have previously discussed in this tome, guards come in all varieties. Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon. Guards are not all the hardened and grizzled ex-military types we think of at the upper ranks of the orders. Be observant, young adventurer, and heed the warnings of the law, for while the guards may only be a minor threat to your dastardly visions, what lays in wait in the city dungeon may not be worth the risks!</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 347","class":{}},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"traits":{"size":"med","senses":"","languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":"","rwak":"","msak":"","rsak":"","abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""},"damage":"","abilityCheck":"","abilitySave":"","skillCheck":""},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"rrnxPo7WqYKF2t4q","sort":100001,"flags":{"_sheetTab-sidebar":"traits","_sheetTab-primary":"biography"},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/GuardBlueM.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Guard","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/GuardBlueM.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"cxx3q0igAzCWfE3R","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"2reHgwNJRFbhmxqA","flags":{},"name":"Chain Shirt","type":"equipment","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/items/armor/scale.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather.

Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to. These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves. Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door. Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant’s abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures. Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals. A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself. Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur. Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth. Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size:

Her thick medium-brown hair is tied up in an enormous bun on the back of her head. She wears a thick mint-green apron, which is dusted with flour, over ordinary clothing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Known History</h2>\n<p>Berkla's Breakfast is an older establishment than @JournalEntry[zwlktKnMNJkh8pls]{The Caped Crawler}; Berkla will proudly tell you she's been running it for 51 years.

The answer is that she did wield them for a few years in her youth, but never felt worthy of inheriting them. Many of her adventuring companions died in her four years of adventuring, which convinced her she was not cut out to be a warrior.</p>\n<h2>Detail</h2>\n<p>Berkla lost more than friends in her adventuring years; a DC 15 Perception check will reveal that her left eye is made of glass.</p>\n<h2>Private Life</h2>\n<p>Berkla is somewhat estranged from her husband, who lives with their two children in Serudyn.</p>\n</section>","public":""},"race":"","type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":1,"spellLevel":1,"xp":{"value":200},"source":""},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10}},"traits":{"size":"med","senses":"","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":2,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"3gAPu1nBXXcEoKaE","sort":300000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Berkla Butterbrewer","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"htB7nAW0Fm2Y6WyP","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[]}

If they are encountered near a former battle site, they are likely to be collecting blood, which may give the PCs a clue about what is really going on in the Dungeon. Otherwise, when encountered, they will simply be observing the PCs, preparing to report on the newcomers' capability to Dimefinos.</p>\n<p><strong>Itia</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Iete</strong> are the most cowardly of the five, likely to run away at the first sign of trouble. The other three would still prefer to talk their way out of a confrontation with the PCs rather than fight to the death.</p>\n<h2>Religious Views</h2>\n<p>All of the imps nominally respect the infernal hierarchy of Carsigel, but four of them are pretty jaded and irreverent about it in practice. The exception is&nbsp;<strong>Ryb</strong>, who piously prays to Glasya regularly.</p>\n<h1>Physical Characteristics</h1>\n<p><strong>Ryb</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Itia</strong> are female;&nbsp;<strong>Engec</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Iete</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Iashy</strong> are male.</p>\n<p><strong>Ryb</strong> has a violent scar across her face, from ear to nose to other ear.</p>\n<p><strong>Itia</strong> has had the tip of her tail cut off by a silvered weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Engec</strong> has a pale blue birthmark on his chest, unlike the others who are just red, and speaks with a comically low voice, whereas the others have high-pitched, screechy voices.</p>\n<p><strong>Iete</strong> has a tic where his head, left arm, and left wing twitch constantly.</p>\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n<p>Besides <strong>Iashy's</strong> diamond necklace, each of the imps carries three waterskins to use for collecting blood.</p>\n<h1>Personal History</h1>\n<p><strong>Ryb</strong>, <strong>Itia</strong>, <strong>Engec</strong>, and <strong>Iete</strong>, being sort of outcasts for various reasons,&nbsp;were bound to Dimefinos when he was exiled. He brought them with him without giving them a choice in the matter. They resented this initially, but have mostly come around to the fact that their lot isn't currently so bad, for imps.</p>\n<p><strong>Iashy</strong> served under a devil in Carsigel who dealt with Dimefinos remotely, and saw and admired the harvest of souls that Dimefinos was collecting. He came to work for the archdevil proactively. Fortunately for the other four, Dimefinos still treats Iashy almost with the same lack of respect that he shows to them.

Resembling something of a net, the spider’s web serves a dual purpose: to capture food upon its sticky surface and to give the spider a safe place to perch away from predators. Once an insect is trapped within the web, the spider quickly wraps the unsuspecting creature in a bundle of webbing, saving its prize for later consumption. While all spiders are venomous in some capacity, many will not be harmful to the adventurer on their travels.

Cousin to the common spider, a scorpion bears nearly no resemblance to the web-spinner beyond its eight legs. Scorpions host a segmented body that culminates in a long, knob-ended tail bearing a needle-like stinger upon its end. This stinger bears a venomous toxin which can range from mildly irritating to direly deadly depending upon the species. At the other end of the scorpion’s body lay two crab-like claws that aid it in gripping prey while the scorpion’s venom works through the unfortunate insect’s body.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitin and Hate.</strong> Scorpions may live in a variety of environments, but they are most numerous in deserts and dusty plains. These little arachnids find solace from the harsh rays of the sun within scrub brush, under rocks, and within stolen burrows deep below the earth. From these nestled hideouts the scorpion can quickly lash out at any unsuspecting morsel who wanders into their domain. Make doubly sure to carry an antitoxin in your pack when venturing out into the desert, adventurer, for within a hero’s sturdy boots is one of the scorpion’s favorite places to hide.</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text;

have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight!&nbsp; Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp.&nbsp; What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night.&nbsp; The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath.&nbsp; The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigations without the aid of their eyes.&nbsp; It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li

befitting your particular game system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Denizens of filth, scavengers in our sewers, and vectors of contaigens, no singular animal may present such an impact upon humanoid life as does the rat.&nbsp; Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to.&nbsp; These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves.&nbsp; Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door.&nbsp; Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant’s abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures.&nbsp; Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals.&nbsp; A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself.&nbsp; Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur.&nbsp; Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth.&nbsp; Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #111111;\"><em style=\"box-sizing:

Spiders are arachnids with eight thin legs protruding from their dual-segmented body.&nbsp; Atop the spider’s tiny head are eight glistening eyes with which it views the world in relative obscurity.&nbsp; While the spider’s eyesight may be poor regardless of the number of eyes, they have a clever trick up their sleeves: the spider’s web!</p>\n<p><strong>Some Bug.</strong> Ingenious little architects, spiders produce a silken thread from their rears dubbed “webbing” which they use to construct elaborate homes.&nbsp; Resembling something of a net, the spider’s web serves a dual purpose: to capture food upon its sticky surface and to give the spider a safe place to perch away from predators.&nbsp; Once an insect is trapped within the web, the spider quickly wraps the unsuspecting creature in a bundle of webbing, saving its prize for later consumption.&nbsp; While all spiders are venomous in some capacity, many will not be harmful to the adventurer on their travels.&nbsp; Simply avoid webs where you see them and be quite sure that the web which you see only belongs to a standard spider species, as a plethora of gigantic and magical varieties also lurk within similar webs!</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

navigate terrain in near total darkness.&nbsp; This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar.&nbsp; Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight!&nbsp; Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp.&nbsp; What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night.&nbsp; The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath.&nbsp; The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigations without the aid of their eyes.&nbsp; It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing:
