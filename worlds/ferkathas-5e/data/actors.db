Stirges resemble nothing more than a slightly oversized bat crossed with a mosquito; however, upon closer inspection the Stirge reveals much more. Coated in greasy, pink flesh (save for a small tufted mane of white fur about its head and neck) the Stirge is equipped with a pair of small, bat-like wings made of stretched flesh between struts of thin bone. The skin here at the wing is so thin that light may easily shine through the beast's wings revealing the tiny vesicles within. Stirges also possess a set of six, spindly legs above their pig-like tail. Each leg is tipped with a set of hooked claws which allows the fiend to grip into the flesh of its prey and hang on should a struggle ensue. However, there is one more feature that makes the Stirge truly repugnant.</p>\n<p><strong>What's Your Type?</strong> Stirges are notable for their ravenous desire to consume the blood of living organisms. These beasts accomplish this foul act with aid from the needle-sharp proboscis waiting at the end of its oversized snout. Gifted with the ability of flight, the Stirge dives down upon an unsuspecting enemy and clamps onto their body with the aid of their barbed claws.

Thinking myself a rather clever sleuth in finding some ill-witted bandit’s secret treasures, I did quickly reach my hand within the tunnel only to be greeted by something oddly fuzzy and a most severe pain to boot! Let my incident (and missing finger) with the woodland badger be warning to those lacking in wisdom; do not reach into places where your hand does not belong!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>- Merchant Lord Ellemond Doughty.</p>\n<p>The common forest dwelling badger is a creature of ingenuity and sheer determination. This creature, resembling a most rotund and powerful weasel, busies itself upon the forest floor catching its prey of insects and small mammals all the while toiling away at creating itself a sett, or more commonly called, a burrow. The badger’s coat is decked in marvelous black and white stripes running the length of its body. With gentle eyes and an otherwise calm demeanor, the badger exudes an image of a more timid beast; however, this outer appearance should be observed with caution. Armed with thick, elongated claws made for churning through the toughest of soil and a set of powerful jaws to match, badgers are quick to defend themselves should a foolish soul harass them. As long as you do not agitate the badger, it will find no recourse to harm you.</p>\n<p><strong>Miraculous Mandibles.</strong> A badger’s most intriguing feature is a set of peculiar jawbones with provide it with a spectacular method of defense. The animal’s jaws are set into long cavities within its skull allowing the badger to lock its jaws in place thus increasing its already powerful bite strength and avoid the possibility of mandible dislocation. A truly remarkable evolutionary advantage in avoiding combat (rather than confronting its adversary) is the badger’s natural odor. These creatures can release a powerful musk from scent glands located near their rears which can easily drive away predators. It is for these reasons that many forest dwelling cultures revere the badger as a guardian of the forest and attempt to utilize the badger’s unique abilities in their own bid for survival in the wilds of our world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select:

Weasels make quite effective pest controllers in their territories as they eat multitudes of rodents annually. These little cleaners are, however, often considered to be pests in their own right; farmers across the countryside report that their poultry is killed or stolen away by sneaky weasels making their way into their chicken coops. While not the most deadly mammal in the world, the weasel does pack a nasty, sharp-toothed bite.

He is disguised by an Alter Self spell.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>More Alias Details</h2>\n<p>Tolfos is a casual believer in the Southern Viryan religion (the most popular religion in the region).</p>\n<p>He was divorced at a young age, with no children. If the subject of family comes up, he talks wistfully about his ex-wife at some length. Her name was Fiona, she was a redhead who washed dishes compulsively and would never stop talking about her birdwatching hobby. They fought over money all the time.</p>\n<p>His only current family is his beloved cat, Rammi, who lives at his house.</p>\n<p>He is very satisfied with his career. He likes to use the catchphrase \"Like a frog waiting for a fly\" whenever half-appropriate. He knows Smigrin and Rakian Common, which he was forced to learn as a child by an austere Rakian tutor.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Masquerade Habits</h2>\n<p>Obviously, as an archdevil, Dimefinos is far older than \"Tolfos\" appears to be, and subscribes to no mortal religion. His wealth reserves are also far vaster even than they seem to be, which explains why he can offer generous prices to adventurers who shop at his Magic Shop.</p>\n<p>Dimefinos spends most of his waking hours at the Beehive, but retreats to his lair in the Dungeon at night when the shop is closed. His house in town is a facade; he tries to keep it dusted, but a character who makes a DC 25 Perception or Investigation check there can find signs that it's not actually lived in. No one in town has really noticed that \"Tolfos\" is seldom seen walking between his shop and his house.</p>\n<p>His beloved cat, Rammi, is the product of a Major Image spell.</p>\n<p>A careful observer might note that Tolfos hires no employees to assist him with his shop, even though he clearly has the means to do so. This is a clue that he is keeping something secret.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>True History and Motivations</h2>\n<p>Dimefinos was banished from Carsigel to the Prime Plane about 1472 V.Y. (65 years ago) for scheming to topple his Devilish duke—typical devil stuff, really. There was no condition set for his return to his luxurious immortal position, but he really hopes that collecting a massive bank of owned souls will function as immortal currency to help him pull some strings eventually.</p>\n<p>To that end, he harvests the souls slain in Felwarren Dungeon and stores them in gemstones using a magic ritual (which requires the blood of the slain). He also has built two magical Beacons in the Dungeon that attract a continual supply of fodder for adventurers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Companion Devils</h2>\n<p>Having once been in a fairly prominent position in Carsigel, he has an entourage of devils who were forced to come with him to the Prime Plane, and more than he has recruited or bound to his will since. These include his consort, an erinyes named Flugarra; his butler/watchman, an osyluth named Osghao; and, most likely for the PCs to encounter, a team of imps who collect the blood of the fallen throughout the dungeon: @Actor[m2yJBMkeTKtDHH5I]{Ryb, Itia, Engec, Iete, and Iashy}.</p>\n</section>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Evil","race":"","type":"Fiend (Devil)","environment":"","cr":16,"spellLevel":16,"xp":{"value":15000},"source":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["cold","poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["fire"],"custom":"Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing from nonmagical, non-silvered attacks"},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","exhaustion","frightened","poisoned"],"custom":""},"senses":"Darkvision 120 ft, Passive Perception 16","languages":{"value":[],"custom":"All"},"perception":{"value":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":6,"prof":0,"total":6,"passive":16},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":6,"prof":0,"total":6,"passive":16},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":7,"prof":0,"total":7,"passive":17},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":4,"prof":0,"total":4,"passive":14},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":8,"prof":5,"total":13,"passive":23},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":7,"prof":0,"total":7,"passive":17},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":6,"prof":5,"total":11,"passive":21},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":8,"prof":5,"total":13,"passive":23},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":7,"prof":0,"total":7,"passive":17},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":6,"prof":0,"total":6,"passive":16},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":7,"prof":0,"total":7,"passive":17},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":6,"prof":0,"total":6,"passive":16},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":8,"prof":0,"total":8,"passive":18},"per":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":8,"prof":5,"total":13,"passive":23},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":7,"prof":0,"total":7,"passive":17},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":6,"prof":0,"total":6,"passive":16},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":6,"prof":0,"total":6,"passive":16},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":6,"prof":0,"total":6,"passive":16}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":4,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":3,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":3,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":3,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":2,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":1,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":1,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":1,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":"3","max":"3"},"legres":{"value":"3","max":"3"},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"3gAPu1nBXXcEoKaE","sort":100000,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":802,"width":900}}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Tolfos Litann","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"FOQRsNzuWj3Hw9hm","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"qp4aN4ULV4sotgvx","flags":{"favtab":{"isFavourite":true}},"name":"Silver Sword","type":"weapon","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/items/weapons/sword-long.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A devilish weapon.

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common⁠ triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.</p>\n<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics⁠ (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\n<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere⁠ with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere⁠ when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Death.</strong> Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.</li>\n<li><strong>Discord.</strong> Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication⁠ and has disadvantage on Attack rolls and Ability Checks.</li>\n<li><strong>Fear.</strong> Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes Frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While Frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.</li>\n<li><strong>Hopelessness.</strong> Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack⁠ or target any creature with harmful Abilities, Spells, or other magical Effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Insanity.</strong> Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take Actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its Movement, which is erratic.</li>\n<li><strong>Pain.</strong> Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes Incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.</li>\n<li><strong>Sleep.</strong> Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls Unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.</li>\n<li><strong>Stunning.</strong> Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes Stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 280","activation":{"type":"minute","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"perm"},"target":{"value":0,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"touch"},"uses":{"value":1,"max":1,"per":"day"},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["10d10","necrotic"]],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"con","dc":21,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"level":7,"school":"abj","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"Mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes","consumed":true,"cost":1000,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"innate","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":800000},{"_id":"oFRjbCwyXGs80Jsb","flags":{},"name":"Greater Invisibility","type":"spell","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/fog-water-air-3.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You or a creature you touch becomes Invisible until the spell ends.

Her eyes lack an epicanthal fold, however, marking her as not purely Old Smigrin ethnically, in spite of what her last name sounds like.</p>\n<p>Shirlin wears pretty ordinary clothing, due to the danger to her wardrobe of working as a bartender.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Known History</h2>\n<p>As a young woman, Shirlin worked as a mercenary caravan guard, and passed through @JournalEntry[sVglzZF3B6yGR0LS]{Felwarren} in 1500 V.Y. (37 years ago). Two years later, she returned to the town, seeing the potential for an enterprising business there.</p>\n<p>She was right. Her inn-and-tavern, catering to adventurers who wish to explore @JournalEntry[RWHucd7pBiK3JXSS]{Felwarren Dungeon}, is famous far and wide for its success, and the success it supposedly imparts to its patrons.</p>\n<p>Besides her employees at the tavern, Shirlin is most closely associated with @Actor[FOQRsNzuWj3Hw9hm]{Tolfos}, the shopkeeper down the street who invested in her business from near its beginning. They are good friends to this day.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<section><strong>Age:</strong> 58</section>\n<section><strong>Weight:</strong> 160 lb.</section>\n<section><hr>\n<h2>Personality</h2>\n<p>Shirlin has a very open personality that hides little. She is somewhat brusque, but friendly and outgoing enough. She is a competent bartender, fair to her employees and business-savvy.</p>\n<p>As a hobby, she enjoys gardening her flower gardens out in the back of the inn. She also considers the olive tree there something of a companion spirit, since it has been with her since the founding of her establishment.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>Important Detail</h2>\n<p>With a DC 10 Perception check, an observer can notice that the jeweled bracelet Shirlin wears is actually quite riddled with very expensive gems, and marks her as actually quite wealthy in spite of how plain the rest of her clothing is. The bracelet is worth 2,200 gp.</p>\n<h2>Private Life</h2>\n<p>Shirlin has no sexual attraction or interests to speak of, and is therefore a spinster. She is something of an open book, and is pretty happy with her lot in life as a wealthy business owner. She does not live in her own inn, but owns a nice manor on the eastern edge of town.</p>\n<p>All is not as it seems in her relationship with Tolfos. She doesn't know his big secret, but she is a little suspicious of how many of her debts to him he has forgiven over the years. She worries that someday he will want to collect some other kind of favor from her in return for those forgiven debts.</p>\n<p>She grew up in the city of Shiang, in the Vernland, across the East Spur of mountains from Felwarren.</p>\n</section>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral","race":"","type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":200},"source":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["dwarvish"],"custom":"Smigrin"},"perception":{"value":"13"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"per":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":2,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"legres":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"3gAPu1nBXXcEoKaE","sort":0,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Shirlin Sotei","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"FtEPBJMYwTcpG7fs","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"kTW2ijHTRFqTiOgR","flags":{"_sheetTab":"details","entityorder":{"order":218}},"name":"Action Surge","type":"feat","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/red_01.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment.

These four legged friends are of course familiar to all whom read this tome and can come in thousands of various breeds and sizes. What makes these little reptiles so very unique (and possibly a fine form for your familiar) is their ability to cling to a multitude of surfaces. Adept at climbing, lizards may scale sheer surfaces and procure hidden vantage points from which to gaze down upon those you may wish to observe. Some varieties of lizards are also able to shift the pigmentation of their flesh, allowing for further subterfuge options! However, the humble lizard does not provide much in the way of offense as their bite is nothing more than a nuisance to most humanoids. The lizard is perhaps best left to the shadows, where it may observe the world unseen for its clever master.</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":null,"cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 332","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"Darkvision 30 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true,"value":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":"","rwak":"","msak":"","rsak":"","abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""},"damage":"","abilityCheck":"","abilitySave":"","skillCheck":""},"resources":{"legact":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"legres":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"tDRumKb9mlMZWc8f","sort":750000,"flags":{"betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Lizard.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Lizard","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Lizard.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"ShhFEKOpVCx6b627","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"AlO7NtMS64z0faPM","flags":{},"name":"Bite","type":"weapon","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/red_29.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+0 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

Bats are a nocturnal creature prized by arcanists for their ability to navigate terrain in near total darkness. This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar. Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight! Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp. What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night. The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath. The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigation without the aid of their eyes. It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color:

Please note that “Giant” is a relative term and this creature is only giant in relative terms to its common size.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Snakes rank among the most plentiful and diverse reptiles to slither across our planet’s surface.&nbsp; Resembling nothing more than a scaly worm at first look, snakes are actually highly developed predators who slither across the ground in order to stealthily hunt their prey of smaller reptiles, rodents, and birds.&nbsp; Though there are many species of snake, we will only discuss the poisonous varieties within this article.&nbsp; Poisonous snakes bear a marked identifier separating them from their nonpoisonous brethren: the shape of their pupils.&nbsp; While snakes lacking venom glands have rounded pupils, those snakes with a venomous bite have slitted pupils much like those of a common domestic cat.&nbsp; The devious snake, however, has so much more beneath its scaly surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t Tread on Me.</strong>&nbsp; Ever camouflaged both by their similarities to roots, sticks, or branches as well as the marvelous patterns of black, browns, greens, and tans speckling their hides, snakes are masters of blending into their surroundings.&nbsp; Even perched on a rock to warm their bodies in the heat of the sun, snakes can certainly be missed by just a passing glance.&nbsp; While the creature’s eyesight is relatively poor, snakes have adapted an amazing ability to sense the world around them.&nbsp; Snakes “smell” with their tongues!&nbsp; Yes, by flicking their tongues out of their mouths with a fascinating flourish, these reptiles are able to smell prey or predators in their environment by collecting the miniscule scents on their tongues.&nbsp; Within the snake’s mouth lies its most deadly asset in the form of two, hollow fangs.&nbsp; Snakes prefer to strike from the shadows, allowing their quiet method of travel to get them close enough to their prey to avoid a fight.&nbsp; The creature then lashes out in the blink of an eye, catching the unwary prey in their jaws while injecting them with a controlled dose of highly toxic venom through their hollow fangs.&nbsp; Then it’s only a matter of moments until the poor creature is left dead by the snake’s potent toxins.&nbsp; While the majority of snake species are not deadly to humanoids, caution is advised for those not well versed in identifying reptiles.&nbsp; Antidote should always be carried in areas known to house populations of poisonous snakes, just in case.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Weasels are tiny, long bodied mammals reaching approximately eight inches in length and bearing coat colorations ranging from chestnut brown to pale white. The weasel’s long body allows it to easily wedge itself into a rodent’s burrow and pull the critter out for a tasty meal. Weasels make quite effective pest controllers in their territories as they eat multitudes of rodents annually. These little cleaners are, however, often considered to be pests in their own right; farmers across the countryside report that their poultry is killed or stolen away by sneaky weasels making their way into their chicken coops. While not the most deadly mammal in the world, the weasel does pack a nasty, sharp-toothed bite. Keep your curious fingers out of any small rodent burrows you find, lest you end up provoking a weasel during his well-earned meal.</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size:

Dwellers of the coastal urban sprawl see the armored law keepers near daily as they patrol the streets, guard our gates, inspect shipments, and of course assist (or arrest) those citizens of their fair cities. However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls. Be they mercenary or professional, guards are often found patrolling the roads, either to sweep away stray packs of animals or bandits, or on alert to protect precious cargo or important citizens as they travel the less settled areas of the world. Much like the bandits and cultists who we have previously discussed in this tome, guards come in all varieties. Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon. Guards are not all the hardened and grizzled ex-military types we think of at the upper ranks of the orders. Be observant, young adventurer, and heed the warnings of the law, for while the guards may only be a minor threat to your dastardly visions, what lays in wait in the city dungeon may not be worth the risks!</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 347","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"","languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true,"value":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":"","rwak":"","msak":"","rsak":"","abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""},"damage":"","abilityCheck":"","abilitySave":"","skillCheck":""},"resources":{"legact":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"legres":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"rrnxPo7WqYKF2t4q","sort":100001,"flags":{"_sheetTab-sidebar":"traits","_sheetTab-primary":"biography","betterNpcSheet":{"sheet":{"height":600,"width":600}}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/GuardBlueM.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Guard","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/GuardBlueM.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"cxx3q0igAzCWfE3R","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"2reHgwNJRFbhmxqA","flags":{"betternpcsheet5e":{"showItemSummary":false}},"name":"Chain Shirt","type":"equipment","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/items/armor/scale.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather.

Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to. These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves. Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door. Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant’s abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures. Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals. A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself. Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur. Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth. Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size:

Giant centipedes think little beyond their next meal and will attack nearly any creature who enter into their territory, lashing out with their crushing mandibles capable of breaking through leather armor with ease.&nbsp; Once the centipede has successfully gripped its victim with its pinching mandibles, it delivers a potent poison into its target’s blood stream which (in rare cases) may act as a minor paralytic should the creature fall unconscious while poisoned.&nbsp;

If they are encountered near a former battle site, they are likely to be collecting blood, which may give the PCs a clue about what is really going on in the Dungeon. Otherwise, when encountered, they will simply be observing the PCs, preparing to report on the newcomers' capability to Dimefinos.</p>\n<p><strong>Itia</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Iete</strong> are the most cowardly of the five, likely to run away at the first sign of trouble. The other three would still prefer to talk their way out of a confrontation with the PCs rather than fight to the death.</p>\n<h2>Religious Views</h2>\n<p>All of the imps nominally respect the infernal hierarchy of Carsigel, but four of them are pretty jaded and irreverent about it in practice.

He brought them with him without giving them a choice in the matter.

Spiders are arachnids with eight thin legs protruding from their dual-segmented body. Atop the spider’s tiny head are eight glistening eyes with which it views the world in relative obscurity. While the spider’s eyesight may be poor regardless of the number of eyes, they have a clever trick up their sleeves: the spider’s web!</p>\n<p><strong>Some Bug.</strong> Ingenious little architects, spiders produce a silken thread from their rears dubbed “webbing” which they use to construct elaborate homes. Resembling something of a net, the spider’s web serves a dual purpose: to capture food upon its sticky surface and to give the spider a safe place to perch away from predators. Once an insect is trapped within the web, the spider quickly wraps the unsuspecting creature in a bundle of webbing, saving its prize for later consumption. While all spiders are venomous in some capacity, many will not be harmful to the adventurer on their travels. Simply avoid webs where you see them and be quite sure that the web which you see only belongs to a standard spider species, as a plethora of gigantic and magical varieties also lurk within similar webs!</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li

Cousin to the common spider, a scorpion bears nearly no resemblance to the web-spinner beyond its eight legs. Scorpions host a segmented body that culminates in a long, knob-ended tail bearing a needle-like stinger upon its end. This stinger bears a venomous toxin which can range from mildly irritating to direly deadly depending upon the species. At the other end of the scorpion’s body lay two crab-like claws that aid it in gripping prey while the scorpion’s venom works through the unfortunate insect’s body.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitin and Hate.</strong> Scorpions may live in a variety of environments, but they are most numerous in deserts and dusty plains. These little arachnids find solace from the harsh rays of the sun within scrub brush, under rocks, and within stolen burrows deep below the earth. From these nestled hideouts the scorpion can quickly lash out at any unsuspecting morsel who wanders into their domain. Make doubly sure to carry an antitoxin in your pack when venturing out into the desert, adventurer, for within a hero’s sturdy boots is one of the scorpion’s favorite places to hide.</p>\n<ul

system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bats are a common fixture within the secluded forests and lightless caverns of our world.&nbsp; Bats are a nocturnal creature prized by arcanists for their ability to navigate terrain in near total darkness.&nbsp; This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar.&nbsp; Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight!&nbsp; Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp.&nbsp; What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night.&nbsp; The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath.&nbsp; The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigations without the aid of their eyes.&nbsp; It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Denizens of filth, scavengers in our sewers, and vectors of contaigens, no singular animal may present such an impact upon humanoid life as does the rat.&nbsp; Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to.&nbsp; These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves.&nbsp; Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door.&nbsp; Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant’s abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures.&nbsp; Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals.&nbsp; A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself.&nbsp; Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur.&nbsp; Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth.&nbsp; Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing:

Spiders are arachnids with eight thin legs protruding from their dual-segmented body.&nbsp; Atop the spider’s tiny head are eight glistening eyes with which it views the world in relative obscurity.&nbsp; While the spider’s eyesight may be poor regardless of the number of eyes, they have a clever trick up their sleeves: the spider’s web!</p>\n<p><strong>Some Bug.</strong> Ingenious little architects, spiders produce a silken thread from their rears dubbed “webbing” which they use to construct elaborate homes.&nbsp; Resembling something of a net, the spider’s web serves a dual purpose: to capture food upon its sticky surface and to give the spider a safe place to perch away from predators.&nbsp; Once an insect is trapped within the web, the spider quickly wraps the unsuspecting creature in a bundle of webbing, saving its prize for later consumption.&nbsp; While all spiders are venomous in some capacity, many will not be harmful to the adventurer on their travels.&nbsp; Simply avoid webs where you see them and be quite sure that the web which you see only belongs to a standard spider species, as a plethora of gigantic and magical varieties also lurk within similar webs!</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

description of this creature.&nbsp; Please note that “Giant” is a relative term and this creature is only giant in relative terms to its common size.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bats are a common fixture within the secluded forests and lightless caverns of our world.&nbsp; Bats are a nocturnal creature prized by arcanists for their ability to navigate terrain in near total darkness.&nbsp; This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar.&nbsp; Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight!&nbsp; Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp.&nbsp; What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night.&nbsp; The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath.&nbsp; The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigations without the aid of their eyes.&nbsp; It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #111111;\"><em
